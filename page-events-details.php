                        <p>Before we announce the winner of this year's 9on9 Tournament we would like for you to read a bit of history of how this games started. Like many great games, 
                            this all started from a couple of bored children wanting to play something different and fun. Curiosity started this game and this turned into creativity, 
                            then to an actual product. (Sorry if this information is incorrect, it would be nice to learn a more in-depth version of how this all started)</p>

                    <p>In the end, after several hard-fought games, one team emerged as the victor. The players were thrilled with their win, but all
                        involved agreed that the tournament was a great success regardless of the outcome. It was a great opportunity for students to come
                        together, show off their skills, and have fun while doing it. The 9on9 tournament at SUB, University of Alberta was an unforgettable
                        event that will undoubtedly be talked about for years to come.</p>
