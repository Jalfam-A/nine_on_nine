                        <p class="">9 ON 9 was one of the best games we ve invested in for our summer property.</p>
                        <p class="">It doesn't exclude anyone because literally all ages can play - you can adjust the
                            throwing distance if needed depending on the ages that are playing - and different numbers
                            of people can play. It's a game that's fun for everyone….and one that can get pretty
                            competitive as well!</p>
